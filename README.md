## Getting Started

Before you start working on the FPGA DSP project, make sure you have the necessary tools and hardware set up. This section provides initial steps to help you get started.

### Prerequisites

- Arty Z10 FPGA development board
- FPGA development tools (e.g., Vivado)
- Basic understanding of FPGA programming and Verilog
- (Add any additional prerequisites specific to your project)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FPGA_DSP_Project.git

Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories to help you navigate through the code and resources.

src/: Contains Verilog source code for DSP algorithms and FPGA implementation.
tests/: Includes testbenches and test cases to verify the correctness of DSP algorithms.
doc/: Documentation and resources related to the project.
(Feel free to add or modify directories as your project evolves.)

### DSP Algorithms
This project aims to implement various DSP algorithms, including but not limited to:

FIR (Finite Impulse Response) Filters
IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) Filters
FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
Convolution
Signal Generation and Manipulation
(You can update this list based on your project's goals and requirements.)
