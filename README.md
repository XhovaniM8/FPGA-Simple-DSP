## Getting Started

Before you start working on the FPGA DSP project, make sure you have the necessary tools and hardware set up. This section provides initial steps to help you get started.

### Prerequisites

- Arty Z10 FPGA development board
- FPGA development tools (e.g., Vivado)
- Basic understanding of FPGA programming and Verilog
- (Add any additional prerequisites specific to your project)

### Installation

1. (Add any specific installation instructions or tool setups here)

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories to help you navigate through the code and resources.

- `src/`: Contains Verilog source code for DSP algorithms and FPGA implementation.
- `tests/`: Includes testbenches and test cases to verify the correctness of DSP algorithms.
- `doc/`: Documentation and resources related to the project.

(Feel free to add or modify directories as your project evolves.)

## DSP Algorithms

This project aims to implement various DSP algorithms, including but not limited to:

- FIR (Finite Impulse Response) Filters
- IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) Filters
- FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
- Convolution
- Signal Generation and Manipulation

(You can update this list based on your project's goals and requirements.)

## Development Environment

Describe the development environment, including FPGA development tools, software, and any hardware configurations required for the project.

(Provide detailed setup instructions or link to separate setup documentation.)
